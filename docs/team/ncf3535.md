## Project: MediTask

MediTask is a desktop application designed to help nurses efficiently manage and track their daily tasks via a Command Line Interface (CLI). This CLI tool streamlines task management, allowing nurses to quickly organize, monitor, and complete tasks, ensuring no important steps are missed.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature:** `Hospital` and `Patient` Classes
    - **What it does**: It allows nurses to manage a centralized list of patients within the Hospital system. This includes adding, retrieving, and deleting patient data efficiently.
    - **Justification**: These classes provide the backbone for the system’s data model, enabling efficient patient management and scalable functionality.
    - **Highlights**: Implemented methods for adding, retrieving, deleting, and checking for duplicate patients. Robust error handling and logging enhance maintainability and data integrity.
- **New Feature: Patient Management Commands (`AddPatientCommand`, `DeletePatientCommand`, `ListPatientCommand`, `FindPatientCommand`, `SelectPatientCommand`)**
    - **What it does**: Provides a suite of commands for nurses to interact with the system, enabling them to add new patients, delete existing records, list all patients, find patients by name, and select a specific patient for task-related operations.
    - **Justification**: These commands allow for streamlined management of patient information through a simple CLI interface.
- **New Feature: State Management with `State` and `StateType` Classes**
    - **What it does**: Manages the system’s current operational state (e.g., `MAIN_STATE` or `TASK_STATE`), enabling or restricting certain commands based on active state.
    - **Justification**: Allows for state-dependent command execution, improving usability and system organization.
- **New Feature: Date Formatting and Parsing System**
    - **What it does**: Standardizes date and time inputs across MediTask, allowing nurses to input dates in various formats or use relative terms like “today” and “tomorrow.”
    - **Justification**: Ensures consistency in date handling, reducing errors in task scheduling and improving nurse workflow.
    - **Highlights**: Accounts for a wide range of date entries, including relative terms (“today”, “tomorrow”), weekdays and weekends (e.g., “monday”, “sunday”), and combinations of date-only, time-only, or full date-time entries. The system also includes error handling for invalid formats and warnings for past dates, making date-time input robust and user-friendly.

- **Project management**:
  - Managed release `v1.0` (1 release) on GitHub
- Enhancements to existing features:
    - Updated the `Parser` to handle dates using `DateTime` instead of raw strings. This ensures consistent date formatting, improves validation, and reduces redundancy across date-dependent commands.
- **Documentation**:
  - **User Guide**:
    - Documented `Add`, `Delete`, `Find`, `Select`, and `List` patient commands to improve command clarity and user onboarding ([PR #104](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/104)).
  - **Developer Guide**:
    - Added sequence diagrams for `AddPatient` and `DeletePatient` commands ([PR #101](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/101), [PR #102](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/102)), illustrating execution flow.
    - Included class diagrams for `Hospital`, `State`, and `StateManager` classes ([PR #101](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/101)), clarifying structure and relationships.
    - Updated v1.0 user stories to cover task management functionalities like adding, deleting, marking, and unmarking tasks ([PR #101](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/70)).
- **Community and Contributions**:
  - **PRs Reviewed (with non-trivial comments)**: [PR #95](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/95), [PR #57](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/57), [PR #56](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2113-T11-1/tp/pull/56) – Provided detailed feedback on logic improvements and error handling, ensuring robust and maintainable code.
  - Contributed to design discussions on project structure and best practices.
